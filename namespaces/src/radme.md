ALL these are server only

Send an event from the server to this socket only:

socket.emit()
socket.send()

Send an event from a socket to a room:

NOTE: remember, this will not go to the sending socket

socket.to(roomName).emit()
socket.in(roomName).emit()

Because each socket has it's own room, named by it's socket.id, a socket can send a message to another socket:

socket.to(anotherSocketId).emit('hey');
socket.in(anotherSocketId).emit('hey');

A namespace can send a message to any room:

io.of(aNamespace).to(roomName).emit()
io.of(aNamespace).in(roomName).emit()

A namespace can send a message to the entire namespace

io.emit()
io.of('/').emit()
io.of('/admin').emit()
